## Carol Ramsey's Week 1 Post

**1. What did you do this past week?**

I found the command line on my Mac. I haven't seen a command line in over ten years. 

I built the project management and development processes for Oracle Retail that over 600 engineers used to build $40 millon+ enterprise releases of 30+ integrated products. The core of the product suite was based on predictive algorithms to optimize supply chain and inventory. Even small decreases in items returned from the stores saved the retailers significant money.

I have been busy! But for about least ten years, I've been in management and not writing code. So, this past week, I found the command line. I setup the tools and accounts. I wrote my first blog post. 

**2. What's in your way?**

I need to spend significant time in the early weeks of the class learning the tools so I can focus on the meat of the projects going forward.  

**3. What will you do next week?**

I will meet with the TAs to work through remaining questions about the tools. I will connect with the folks in my group. I will try to come up with an easy way to explain why I’m a UT CS graduate taking an undergrad CS course when I’m old enough to be everyone’s Mom. Even my own Mom wants to know what's going on. :)

**Tip-of-the-Week:**

Chris Stephenson is the head of Education for Google. Her research found that computational thinking is influenced by dispositions as well as knowledge. Her research is more about young folks, but my favorite grown-up developers also share these dispositions:
1. Confidence in dealing with complexity
2. Persistence in working with difficult problems
3. The ability to handle ambiguity.
