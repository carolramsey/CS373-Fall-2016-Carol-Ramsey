title: Week 4 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**

I started the Netflix project early. It's going well. I kept up with the readings, but made mistakes on the quizzes. 

**What's in your way?**

My greatest obstacle is still time. I worked with my husband to further refine our over-engineered life, looking for hidden 15-minute pockets of time. We looked at home, work, church and school, then made choices and compromises. Our next date night is scheduled for March of 2018, on a Friday, between 8 and 10. :) Then we imagined the time machine that would be the most useful. It wouldn't change time, but find extra time instead. 

**What will you do next week?**

I will continue to work on the Netflix project. I feel better about this project, since I understand the tools more and I started earlier. Pair programming is faster than I expected. There is an efficiency to focusing on the logic of the problem or the details of the code, one at a time. It's easier for the person not driving to see mistakes that can be fixed right away, without an extra add/commit/push/Travis cycle. I found the right partner, who also has three kids. We have the computer lab all to ourselves at 7am. 

**Tip of the Week**

I just found the Coding Horror blog, even though it has been around a while: https://blog.codinghorror.com. Jeff Atwood, the co-founder of Stack Overflow and Discourse, writes about technology, being human and the interesting spaces where the two intersect.
