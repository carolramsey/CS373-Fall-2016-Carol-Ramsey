**Tip of the Week**

Pooja Sankar, CEO and founder of Piazza, wrote about <a href = "http://fortune.com/2015/04/20/the-pervasive-bias-against-female-computer-science-majors/">gender bias in CS</a> in 2015. During my undergraduate CS years in the 90s, I experienced many of the same things Ms. Sankar describes. I appreciate her personal experience, her ideas and her use of data to support her ideas.

What was more interesting, however, is that I didn't realize I might be participating in research studies by using Piazza. When Ms. Sankar presents data about women on Piazza being more likely to post a question privately, is she talking about me? 
I'm sure that I signed off on this in a user agreement I didn't read. I'm also sure the research data consists of collective and non-identifiable information. But it feels different than the old days when experiment subjects gave explicit consent. The ability to collect data in new ways using the Internet and social media is exciting and powerful. It will be interesting to see how boundaries change when user data is used for research in new ways as well.
