title: Week 14 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**   

I ate turkey twice, with my family and my in-laws. I didn't study for three whole days. One morning I didn't set an alarm, I woke naturally, and then I went back to sleep. So nice. 

**What's in your way?**   

I have a lot due this week and one of my class projects is in a high-risk state, since I don't know what I needed to know to make it work, to the degree that I might not be able to figure it out. I took on a challenging project that will take a lot of time during the same week as the SWE Test 2. I'm glad I got that one night of good sleep. 

**What will you do next week?**    

For SWE, I will prepare for and deliver the presentation and study for Test 2. 

**Tip of the Week**  

I imagine folks have had all the traditional interview advice they can handle so I will share a story of my worst interview of all time. I can laugh about it now. Ha ha ha ha (cringe) ha ha.   

It was the late 90s and the .com boom was going strong, with just hints of possible future collapse. Jobs were everywhere, salaries were HUGE and people’s emergency savings were in the super-stable, always-rising stock market. I quit one job without having another, because I wanted to. I explored the jungles and beaches Costa Rica for a month, then I got an interview with National Instruments. I was still basking in the glow of being a Java Tech Lead and Project Manager, in the days when I could get job offers from random recruiters in a bar on Saturday night, even if I had too much to drink. I didn’t prepare for the interview. 

I did pretty well early in the interview and I was pretty confident, until the interviewer asked, “What do you think of our products?” Uh, what? You are asking ME questions? Don’t you REALLY NEED me to work for you? Then he asked me how I would traverse a linked list. I hadn't used linked lists in a while and I didn’t take the question very seriously.   

When I didn’t get a call in the next few days to discuss my HUGE salary, I started to wonder. I looked up National Instruments on the Internet and their products were super cool and they had been voted as the best place to work about 10,000 times. Hmmmmm. I thought about the linked list question. If I would have focused for a minute, I could have said, set a pointer to the head, use ‘while pointer <> null’ for the loop test and advance the pointer to pointer->next at the bottom of the loop. That wasn’t hard at all. 

It was about that time then when I heard the news, “NBC lays off 10% of its work force.”   What!?! The ad-based, no-real-revenue tech companies were failing, but the real tech companies and the economy overall were fine! But, no, they weren’t. The .com crash happened, tech in Austin tanked, and I was without a job. 

It's a good time for tech now, with recuiters all around the GDC providing as much free food as one can eat, but it's good to know that economies and industries work in cycles and a bit of planning, saving (in a savings account) and general humility can be valuable career assets.
