title: Week 13 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**
Our team finished the IDB3 project and the coding part of this class is done. I’ve read all the readings, written the last two blog posts and my cheat sheet is under construction. I feel like I’m in a good place in this class to get ready for the second test.  

**What's in your way?**
I have two huge class projects to work on in the next few weeks.  Time will be a challenge, between the projects and the holidays, with all the family commitments. 

**What will you do next week?** 
This week will be a light week for CS. I’m going to keep up with studying the code samples and trying to get non-zero points on the quizzes. 

**Tip of the Week**
Refactoring is an interesting topic for an undergrad CS class because it’s hard to get meaningful practice with refactoring without coding in a real-world code base. This is an example of a larger issue in Computer Science education – how to shrink the gap between contained classroom programming exercises and real-world programming. Classroom programming exercises tend to share these qualities:
•	Pre-defined, stable requirements 
•	Pre-defined boundaries for tools, frameworks, etc.
•	Pre-defined and short time expectations, with no need for estimating, tracking burn-downs, etc.
•	Lack of context with a larger code base
•	Lack of context with a business environment
•	Lack of context with overall SDLC 

One research idea I’m thinking about is the creation of a Code Base Warehouse (CBW), a set of servers, tools and code, housing real-world code bases for real-world applications. The CBW would have a wrapper to allow instructors to stage a given code base in many ways including:
•	With technical issues (for example, fixing a hierarchy mess that needs to be refactored)
•	With A and B options (for example, adding a feature to a well-designed code base vs adding the same feature to a poorly designed codebase) 
•	At different points in the SDLC (for example, following changing defect standards, relative to release dates) 

The CBW would include curriculum matched to staging options and teacher training.

And how is that a “Tip of the Week” exactly? Well, I’m not sure. I suppose the idea is to learn from real code bases when possible. Git/GitHub are pretty amazing for this.
