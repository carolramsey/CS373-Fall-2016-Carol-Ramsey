title: Week 9 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**

The team finished the IDB1 project. Our last hour of the project was trying to get the models.html to work. It was one of those times when the issues seemed simple, but it just didn't work. At one point, in a fit of desperation and humor, Ruben redirected the error message to a file named 'models.html' and delcared, "There it is! We have a models.html!" That was pretty funny. 

To our great dissapointment, we got an email on Friday saying our submission failed because our models.html was in the wrong directory. I had double-checked every filename and directory location, but the models.html file hadn't been pushed yet. I should have checked again after the final build and merge to master. The submission process is simple in a way, but there are  many possible ways to make a mistake and no way to test the submission. It would be great if students could run a script that tests the basics of the submission (file locations, JSON fields missing, etc.), so they can fix any erorrs. This would save the TAs time and help students avoid costly mistakes. Since we don't have that now, I will double-triple-check our submissions using the final code for IDB2 and IDB3. 

**What's in your way?**

Nothing but time. 

**What will you do next week?** 

Our team has three coding days scheduled this week. Also, I am going to study the class material before class and after, to understand the code at at a deeper level and do better on the quizzes.
