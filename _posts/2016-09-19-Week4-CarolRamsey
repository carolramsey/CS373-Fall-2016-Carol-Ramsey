title: Week 4 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**

I started the Netflix project early. Yeah! I kept up with the readings, but 

**What's in your way?**

My greatest obstacle is still time. I worked with my husband to further refine our over-engineered life, looking for hidden 15-minute pockets of time. We looked at home, work, church and school, then made choices and compromisses. Our next date night is scheduled for March of 2018, on a Friday, between 8 and 10. :) Then we imagined the time machine that would be the most useful. It wouldn't change time, but find extra time instead. 

**What will you do next week?**

I will continue to work on the Netflix project. I feel better about this project, since I understand the tools more and I started earlier. Pair programming is faster than I expected. There is an efficiency to focusing on the logic or the code, without having to switch continually. It was also easier for the person not driving to see mistakes that could be fixed right away, without an extra add/commit/push/travis cycle. 

**Tip of the Week**

(This is my own tip, for something different to write. Let me know if that isn't OK.)





My tip is to know the business context for the lines of code. Whatever is going on around the project can impact which lines of code work best.
