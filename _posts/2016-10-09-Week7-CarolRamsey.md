title: Week 7 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**

I wrote a lot of code samples and then took the test. Python is growing on me. I'm wroking with a Raspberry Pi for a semester project in my physics class, so I'll get to write more python code. 

**What's in your way?**

Nothing is in my way.     

**What will you do next week?**

I had been focusing my study time on the readings and not the code from class time. I need to experiment with code in the interpreter and write code segments after each class, not just before the test. I will also keep up with the readings, but I am beginning to wonder why I read the whole Javascript book! Well, I did get that one quiz question about block scope right. :) Refactoring looks like the next focus. Refactoring was always a challenge at Oracle, when the code base for the entire retail footprint (over 40 applications) was so large and integrated, and the retail industry margins so thin, that taking time to refactor was a constant struggle. Management: "No refactoring, give me new features!" Developers: "The technical debt we are accumulating will bury us!" In the end, the store-based applications that were developed in Austin were end-of-lifed suddenly when Oracle bought another retail software company with better store-based products. Maybe that is the ultimate refactoring.

**Tip of the Week**

I have just started working with a Raspberry Pi. I love the physicality of it, getting to build with my hands and having my code respond to the real-life, non-digital world. Here is a good <a href = "https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-raspberry-pi-has-revolutionized-emulation/">blog post</a> about how emulations are so much easier now and how you can build your own arcade game if you want.
