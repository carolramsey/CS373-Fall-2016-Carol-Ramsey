title: Week 12 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**

I got a 10 on a quiz and did a happy dance in my head. I would have gotten another 10, but there was a funky question in there with too many right answers. I started the presentation slide deck and have the basic outline done. 

**What's in your way?**

I'm feeling better about time now. I took a few weekend days and worked from 5am - midnight, writing everything I could ahead of time. I wrote 5 research article critique/relections and most of 4 CS blog posts. This gave me some breathing room during the week.  

**What will you do next week?** 

I will finish the Refactoring book and study the code samples. I will also contribute as much as possible to the team project. One of my daughters was in the hospital last week, so my contributions were slim.

**Tip of the Week**

Pooja Sankar, CEO and founder of Piazza, wrote about <a href = "http://fortune.com/2015/04/20/the-pervasive-bias-against-female-computer-science-majors/">gender bias in CS</a> in 2015. During my undergraduate CS years in the 90s, I experienced many of the same things Ms. Sankar describes. I appreciate her personal experience, her ideas and her use of data to support her ideas.

What was more interesting, however, is that I didn't realize I might be participating in research studies by using Piazza. When Ms. Sankar presents data about women on Piazza being more likely to post a question privately, is she talking about me? 
I'm sure that I signed off on this in a user agreement I didn't read. I'm also sure the research data consists of collective and non-identifiable information. But it feels different than the old days when experiment subjects gave explicit consent. The ability to collect data in new ways using the Internet and social media is exciting and powerful. It will be interesting to see how boundaries and best practices adapt.

One additional note, I didn't identify with the article "I Need Terrible Female Engineers." People have different experiences, so this doesn't necessarily mean anything. But the title is annoying. It's click bait, I guess. But still annoying.
