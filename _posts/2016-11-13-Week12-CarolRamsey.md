title: Week 11 from Carol Ramsey
---

**What did you do this past week?**

I tried to get Angular JS to work for the Unit Test dialog until about 9:30pm last Thursday. Finally the team called it dead and wrote a quick and dirty HTML page to show the Unit Test results. Sometimes being fiercly determined and annoyingly 
stubborn are two versions of the same thing. 

**What's in your way?**

Time and stamina.

**What will you do next week?** 

I'll be taking care of my family a lot this week and keeping up with school.

**Tip of the Week**

It 'Agile' could talk, it would have a lot of stories to tell. Agile has been interpreted and implemented in so many ways, with recurring themes that have improved software development as a whole and with gaps that show software development still has a long way to go. 

My first experience with Agile was at 360Commerce in the early 2000s, when everyone read one of the first Scrum books and decided Agile/Scrum meant "you-don't-have-to-write-requirements." A development team proceeded to write about 100 canned reports while the product managers were on the road at client sites. When the reports went to production, clients submitted about 1000 bugs. It ends up that the retail industry has very specfic formulas for what seem like common sense values like transaction subtotal and total. The reports didn't follow the industry standard and were unusable. There was never enough time to fix that many bugs, so the reports were removed from the product and clients were told to build their own. I thought about the time that developers, maintenance folks, account managers, etc. spent creating the reports and then calming angry customers down. If we could have recaptured that time and energy, we could have built a fancy reports engine that would have made everyone happy. 

I learned several helpful tips from this experience: 1) Read carefully. 2) If something seems to good to be true, like skipping a lot of work, it probably is. 3) It really sucks to throw code away. When a step is annoying or tedious and I'm evaluating various short-cuts, I think about what it would feel like to throw the code away later and I (usually) get back to doing that step.
