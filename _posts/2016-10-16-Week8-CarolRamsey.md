title: Week 8 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**

I found out how many points the blog posts are worth. Oh no, it's a sad day. I've taken the time to write something unique each week, instead of a simple play-by-play. But, that is how it goes sometimes. Besides that, our team formed, our tools are setup and we will start coding on Friday, 10/14. I'm writing this early to leave all available time for the project. 

**What's in your way?**

Nothing is in my way.     

**What will you do next week?**

The quizzes will be the end of me, I'm sure. The funny thing is that I totally understand AFTER I make mistakes on the quizzes. Well, that is a good thing I suppose. 

I'm interested in how the team of five will work. It might seem like a great deal, to divide the work five ways, but with communication and schedules, we might just break even. I'll enjoy getting to know more classmates better. We have three semi-full days blocked off to work together, with additional time on our own, so we should be able to get it done. 

**Tip of the Week**

I co-hosted a screening of Code: Debugging the Gender Gap last week and I spoke about my career in tech during the Q&A. One piece of advice I gave to women going into tech: Don't be too helpful. I am personally drawn to lost causes and I don't need a lot of attention, so now and then, I found myself working very hard on efforts that weren't important to the company. I had to be careful to not volunteer to save something no one else wanted to save (fixing the backlog defects, writing documentation, etc.). I needed to be more like a mercenary, looking out for myself and heading into the front lines of the most important battles. It's not that I woudln't do my share of other work, but if I volunteered or got volunteered for this type of work too often, I lost credibility with the team and I lost opportunities for more important work.
