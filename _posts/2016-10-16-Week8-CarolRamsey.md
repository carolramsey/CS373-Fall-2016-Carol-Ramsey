title: Week 8 from Carol Ramsey
---

**What did you do this past week?**

Our IDB team formed, our tools setup and we started coding on Friday, getting the web page, web server, Javascript, etc. to talk to each other. 

**What's in your way?**

I have a sick kid. She is seven. She isn't too sick, just sick enough so she can't be around other kids and she is bored at home. This is impacted my study time over the weekend and will make next week harder (and sleepier). I did, however, just get to play "Blind Makeup Artist" with her and we both look like mad clowns right now. I thought of adding a picture to this post, but decided against it. 

**What will you do next week?** 

I'm interested in how the team of five will work. It might seem like a great deal, to divide the work five ways, but with communication and schedules, we might just break even. I'll enjoy getting to know more classmates better. We have three semi-full days blocked off to work together, with additional time on our own, so we should be able to get it done. 

**Tip of the Week**

I co-hosted a screening of Code: Debugging the Gender Gap last week and I spoke about my career in tech during a Q&A. One question was - Isn't more fair for everyone if gender wasn't considered at all? A tech career is open to women if they do the work and making a big deal of 'women in tech' gives the impression that they need extra help and aren't as capable. This belief doesn't consider implicit bias that impacts experiences and opportunities for women in tech. For people who have this question, I would ask that they check out the Gender/Career test at <a href = "https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html"> Harvard Implict Bias Tests</a> and then view Facebook's research-based <a href="https://managingbias.fb.com/">Managing Unconscious Bias</a> training. I believe that people in tech would learn something from the two sources, even if they don't agree with it all.
