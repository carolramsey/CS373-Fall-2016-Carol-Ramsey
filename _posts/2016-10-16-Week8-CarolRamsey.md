title: Week 8 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**

I found out how many points the blog posts are worth. Oh no, it's a sad day. I've put time into it each week, to contibute something someone might like to read. But, that is how it goes sometimes. Besides that, our team formed, our tools are setup and we started coding on Friday, getting the web page, web server, Javascript, etc. to talk to each other. 

**What's in your way?**

I have a sick kid. She is seven. She isn't too sick, just sick enough so she can't be around other kids and she is bored at home. This is impacted my study time over the weekend and will make next week harder (and sleepier). I did, however, just get to play "Blind Makeup Artist" with her and we both look like mad clowns right now. I thought of adding a picture to this post, but decided against it. 

**What will you do next week?** 

I'm interested in how the team of five will work. It might seem like a great deal, to divide the work five ways, but with communication and schedules, we might just break even. I'll enjoy getting to know more classmates better. We have three semi-full days blocked off to work together, with additional time on our own, so we should be able to get it done. 

**Tip of the Week**

I co-hosted a screening of Code: Debugging the Gender Gap last week and I spoke about my career in tech during a Q&A. One piece of advice I gave to women going into tech: Don't be too helpful. I am personally drawn to lost causes, so now and then, I found myself working very hard on efforts that weren't important to the company (fixing backlog defects, putting together a training, etc.). I had to be careful to not volunteer (or get volunteered) to do more than my share of this type of work, because it can be seen as being less capable of the "real" work. So, beware of helpful tendencies and focus on the visible and recognized work.
