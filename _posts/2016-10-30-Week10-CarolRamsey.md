title: Week 10 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**
I finished reading the series of articles about design strategies and I wondered, where do these guys work and have they seen production code in the real world? The article's design strategies and patterns are elegant and powerful. The idea that we could all spend part of everyday refactoring brings a smile to my face. 

But later the same day, I'm using End Note, a bibliography research tool, and I can see the bad design from the other side of the UI. The client app handles multiple libraries, but in the web app the user must create multiple user accounts, one for each library. Then there is the manual configuration that requires values like http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url= and http://te7fv6dm8k.search.serialssolutions.com. The relationship between Groups and Group Sets is unique and mysterious and why should organizing folders and tags, with well established best practices and patterns, ever be unique or mysterious?

Then, I forget my password. (That is not uncommon, even though I use 1Password. Don't ask me to explain that.) So, I'm entering my new password and then I start to enter the answer to my security question, "J..." and the app offers to complete the field for me with my Mom's maiden name. It seems that End Note had saved my security question answers in a cookie. 

Now, I am not worried about someone breaking in and stealing my list of references articles for my next research paper. But, the app uses the most common security questions that can't be changed. In the overall ecosystem of security-related data, it is strange to keep grad students' security information in cookies. 

Back to the readings, 



**What's in your way?**

I'm writing this at 4:30am. Time. I need more time.  

**What will you do next week?** 

I am going to get a 10 on a quiz if it's the last thing I do. 

**Tip of the Week**
