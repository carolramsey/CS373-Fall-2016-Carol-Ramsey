title: Week 10 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**
I finished reading the series of articles about design strategies and I wondered, where do these guys work and why is there so much bad code still out there? The article's design strategies and patterns are elegant and powerful. The idea that we could all spend part of everyday refactoring brings a smile to my face. But later the same day, I'm using End Note, a bibliography research tool, and I can see the bad design from the other side of the UI. The client app handles mutiple libraries, but in the web app the user must create two user accounts, one for each library. Which tech lead put that idea on the white board? Which product manager was on vacation too long? Functionality is oddly distributed in the menus. Then, I forget my password. That is not uncommon, even though I use 1Password. (Don't ask me to explain that.) So, I'm entering my new password and then I start to enter the answer to my security question, "J..." and the app offers to complete the field for me with my Mom's maiden name, displayed right there on the screen for anyone to see. It seems that End Note had saved my security question answers in a cookie. 

crazy complex..

Now, I am not worried about someone breaking in and stealing my list of references for articles in 

**What's in your way?**
