title: Week 6 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**

I went through the code examples from class and wrote "the meaning of this is" for each segment and added any questions I had. I'm working through the questions by running tests in the interpreter and working with a study partner. I'm also building a map that shows the big picture - for all the data types and structures, how are they the same and different across various charactaristics (parameters, return value, immutible, indexible, etc.). I also made a list of code segment ideas, to give myself practice in the next few days. 

**What's in your way?**

Nothing is in my way.     

**What will you do next week?**

I will continue to work through the material in these ways: 
1) Read about info on-line, in Python documentation and on the Tutorials Point and Stack Overflow web sites.
2) Play with code samples from class in the interpreter, experimenting with variations and answering any remaining questions.
3) Work on writing code segments with study partner.  
4) Attend TA study sessions. 

I will also wonder about a real-world business application that requires using all the bonus features of Python at the same time. There seem to be many fun and quirky ways to do things (re-ordering parameters, writing 10 logical steps in one line of code, embedding lists in sets in dictionaries then adding tuples to each, then modifying parts of all the above using both in-place and regular operators in an unusual order). But, there should be a balance between fast, dense and clever code and solving a business problem using the simple, maintainable and readable code. It would be cool to see a real-world example using the more clever elements of Python in appropriate ways and also see a few examples of real-world code from different types of applications and get a feel for how much of it is straight forward and simlar to other languages and how much of it is unique to Python and its clever possibilities. 

**Tip of the Week**

Even when school is making you nuts and you arne't sleeping a lot, if you are married, remember to say "hello" to your spouse when you get home. Seriously. You need to say, "hello" and if possible, ask him/her about their day.
