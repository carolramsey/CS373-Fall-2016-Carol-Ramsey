title: Week 5 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**

I built a time machine. I found extra time. My life is over-engineered and dense in a way that is unsustainable, but it might work for 2.5 months. In other interesting news, the beach house my parents have owned for twenty-five years just sold to The Property Brothers TV show. The house will be an example of a really crappy house that needs extreme renovation and serious design updates to be livable. Yes, the house has popcorn ceilings, carpet (in a beach house?), 42 pictures of seagulls and a huge phone shaped like a fish on the wall. But, I have so many sweet memories there, I feel protective and I don't want them to make fun of my parents' house. But they will. :)

**What's in your way?**

Nothing is in my way. At this point, I just need to get it done. 

**What will you do next week?**

I will start studying for the test. I have been making mistakes on quizzes at an alarming rate. I will focus on the code examples, reviewing each for the message they convey and experimenting in the interpreter with the code.   

**Tip of the Week**

(This may not make sense, except that I have a CS degree from UT in 1995 and I spent 20 years in tech, now I'm back in grad school for CS Education, to try to change the world.) A developer with five years of experience is about ten times as productive as the new guy, because experience builds the patterns and pathways in the brain that allow the developer to understand the big picture and be more efficient in his execution. I found that I can simulate this experience and get smarter faster, by learning from experienced developers around me. One of my favorite questions is, "What are the worst lines of code you have ever written?" All developers with five years of experience have a story to tell about this, if they are being honest. So, here is mine. In the mid 90s, before there were coding tools or any control whatsoever, I wrote a clever recursive method to delete existing files in a target directory. Not only was this not necessary from a requirements perspective, it led to a visit with the Vice President to explain how the new guy in QA had just deleted the R: drive. That makes two tips: 1) learn from experienced developers and 2) beware of clever code.
