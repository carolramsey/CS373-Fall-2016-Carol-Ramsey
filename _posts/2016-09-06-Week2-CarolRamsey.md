title: Week 2 from Carol Ramsey

**1. What did you do this past week?**

I tried out a few organization apps to track my assignments and ended up in Excel. All the functionality I need is priority, date and links, with filter and sort. I prefer the most minimal tool that gets the job done. I created a burn down for the semester because I'm a dork and I like to see visible progress. If someone wrote a gamified college organizer so I get fireworks when I finish my homework, then I will use an app. 

The down side of being organized is that I better understand just how much work I have to do and I wonder if I will see my kids before Christmas. 

I'm enjoying the class. The class has a good balance of lecture, code samples, hands-on activity and discussion. I like that Dr. Fraij calls on people by name because it will keep me honest on days when I'm less focused. I like the emphasis on optimization. It adds a layer to the puzzle that is interesting and valuable.

After Tuesday's lecture, I wondered, "How on earth have we not figured this out already?" Dr. Fraij talked about the 1960s when folks wanted to improve software development and they came up with phases and activities to reduce high costs and risk. But the same problems from the 60s still exist today. There is a new SDLC every few years, but we still cancel projects,  rewrite code and live with fragile code in production. Is software inherently more complex than other types of development? Are there unique gaps or conflicts between management and coders? Has research found any answers? I'm curious how the software development methodology that I call "constant urgency for the sake of urgency" has impacted code quality and long term costs. 


**2. What's in your way?**

Mostly the kids. :) They are pretty cute though, so I will keep them. 

**3. What will you do next week?**

I will focus on the Collatz project. I will use Piazza often. I will attend as many study sessions and TA times as possible.

**Tip of the Week**

Joel on Software (Joel Spolsky) is smart about software development and he writes well. Some of his blog posts are outdated and some have new updates. I like this one. Evidence-based Scheduling is a version of Agile (especially related to velocity), so it isn't new, but he explains it well.
