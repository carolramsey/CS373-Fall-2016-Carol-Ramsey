1. What did you do this past week?

2. What's in your way?

3. What will you do next week?

Then describe your experience in the class. Don't regurgitate the details of the content of the class. I'm interested in your personal reaction to the class as a whole. Imagine someone not in the class reading it and you're trying to give them a sense of what it's like to be in the class. Comment on the lectures, the examples, the exercises, the quizzes, the projects, and the tests.

I'd also like you to include a tip-of-the-week that you've discovered and that you think somewhat relevant to software development, for example, an article, a tool, a service, a website, and maybe even a game.
