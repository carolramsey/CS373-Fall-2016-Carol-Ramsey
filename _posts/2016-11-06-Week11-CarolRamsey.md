title: Week 11 from Carol Ramsey

**What did you do this past week?**

I tried to get Angular JS to work for the Unit Test dialog until about 9:30pm last Thursday. Finally the team called it dead and wrote a quick and dirty HTML page to show the Unit Test results. Sometimes being fiercly determined and annoyingly 
stubborn are two versions of the same thing. 


**What's in your way?**

Time and stamina.

**What will you do next week?** 

I'll be taking care of my family a lot this week and keeping up with school when I can.

**Tip of the Week**

When looking back, the word 'Agile,' makes my smile, laugh and reflect at the same time. Working 20+ years in software development, I remember the Agile Manifesto when it first came out and the first Scrum book. I've seen a few dozen implementations of 'Agile,' many of which looked nothing like others.
