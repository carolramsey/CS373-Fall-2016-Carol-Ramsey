## Carol Ramsey's Week 1 Post

**1. What did you do this past week?**
I found the command line on my Mac. I haven't seen a command line in over ten years. 

I built the project management and development processes for Oracle Retail that over 600 engineers used to build $40 millon+ enterprise releases of 30+ integrated products. The core of the product suite (point-of-sale, back office, supply chain, inventory, returns, etc.) was based on algorithms developed by PhD mathematicians to analyze historical patterns to predict which store was most likely to sell an individual pair of jeans (style, color and size) on a given day. The algorithms then adjusted related systems to get each pair of jeans to the right store at the right time. Even small decreases in items returned from the stores saved the retailers significant money.

I have been busy! But I haven’t been writing code. So, this past week, I found the command line. I setup the tools and accounts. I wrote my first blog post. 

**2. What's in your way?**

I need to spend significant time in the early weeks of the class learning the tools so I can focus on the meat of the projects going forward.  

**3. What will you do next week?**

I will meet with the TAs to work through remaining questions about the tools. I will connect with the folks in my group. I will try to come up with an easy way to explain why I’m a UT CS graduate taking an undergrad CS course when I’m old enough to be everyone’s Mom. Even my own Mom wants to know what is up with that. 

**Tip-of-the-Week:**

Chris Stephenson is the head of Education for Google. Her research found that computational thinking was influenced by dispositions as well as knowledge. These are true of all my favorite developers: 
•	Confidence in dealing with complexity
•	Persistence in working with difficult problems
•	The ability to handle ambiguity
